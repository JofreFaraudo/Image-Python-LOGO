# Image to Logo python conversor
### A Python 3 program that, from an image, generates the logo code to draw it
Notes:
* This program takes the images from the directory `/Images`
* The result code will be saved on the directory `/Codes`
* Works with `Pillow` and `Python 3`
* UI in Catalan (sorry for that)
